# About this app

I would like to create an app that allows residents of Philadelphia to create accounts and see information about their neighborhood using the [City of Philadelphia's APIs](http://phlapi.com/index.html).

## As a user, I want to be able to...

- sign up for a new account using my email and optionally, my address
- see relevant information about crime, 311 complaints, etc. for the area immediately around my address
- see real-time updates of neighborhood information
- sign up for email notifications when a new event (311 complaint, crime, etc.) occurs in my neighborhood
- see links to get in touch with city officials about specific events with reference to their id/case number
- see events on a map
- fetch information about other addresses (like workplace, school, etc.)
- see rates of how quickly 311 complaints are resolved, how many properties are being sold per month, etc.
