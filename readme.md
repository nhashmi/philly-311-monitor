# Philly 311 Monitor

[philly311.monitor.com](http://philly311.monitor.com)

This app uses Philadelphia's 311 API to give users information about what's going on in their neighborhood. 

Users can sign up for an account, add an address, and track 311 service requests that have been made in their neighborhood. 


### Next steps

* Include information about the user's address from the city's property data API
* Show service requests on a map
* Allow users to click on a map and see service requests near that address 
* Notify users via email or SMS when one of their tracked service requests is closed
